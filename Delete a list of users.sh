# PART THREE: Delete a list of users
#
# WHY: Jamf Connect allows for just-in-time account creation on a macOS client.
# So this means that an admin may want to just pop in and do some magic, log out
# and go away.  But there's no easy way to clean up after yourself, and like any
# good Girl Scout, we should always leave our campsite better than when we found
# it.

# HOW: 	1) Upload this script into Jamf Pro.  
# 		2) Create an extension attribute to look for the presence of a file 
#			located at $DELETE_USER_TOUCH_FILE (defined below)
#		3) Create a Smart Computer Group based on the extension attribute above
#			and that the file exists
#		4) Create a policy that runs at reoccuring checkin, scoped to computers
#			that belong to the Smart Computer Group above.  Tell the policy to 
#			run this script.

### NOTE: THE JAMF BINARY COMMAND TO DELETE USERS IS COMMENTED OUT BELOW.  YOU MUST UNCOMMENT THIS.  POTENTIAL FOR DATA LOSS!!! ###

# WHAT: Script will read the list of users at $DELETE_USER_TOUCH_FILE and run
#		the jamf binary command to delete that user and all its home directory 
#		data.  It also does a jamf recon at the end to update the extension
#		attribute.  No additional inventory update needed.

##### IMPORTANT FEATURE / BUG WORKAROUND #####
# 
# macOS Big Sur and Monterey do not care if there is a bootstrap token or not,
# if there is only one administrator account, you can't delete it.  
#
# To get around this, we can check for a scenario where there is only one
# admin account with a securetoken, grant admin rights to a standard user for
# a few cycles/seconds, delete the admin account we want to be gone, and then 
# revoke admin rights from that standard account.
#
# THE RISK IS THAT A STANDARD ACCOUNT WILL HAVE ADMIN RIGHTS FOR A FEW SECONDS
# 
# If you don't want this check and privilege escallation to take place,
# modify the variable below - checkForOnlyOneAdmin - to 0 from 1.

# If you don't care if there's only a single admin and this script may
