# PART ONE: Find a list of Jamf Connect users who were created in the last X 
#			minutes
#
# WHY: Jamf Connect allows for just-in-time account creation on a macOS client.
# So this means that an admin may want to just pop in and do some magic, log out
# and go away.  But there's no easy way to clean up after yourself, and like any
# good Girl Scout, we should always leave our campsite better than when we found
# it.
# 
# HOW: Upload this script into Jamf Pro.  Create a policy to run the script with
# and ongoing excution frequency and set to run via Self Service.  It may make 
# sense to restrict the app to specific users and require that IT folks sign in  
# to self service to prevent some users from running the script.
#
# WHAT: We'll search all the accounts that have passwords, see if it was created
# with Jamf Connect, determine if the account was created within the last X 
# minutes (you can adjust the number below).  If yes, will be added to a space 
# delimited list of user account short names to be written to 
# /private/tmp/.userCleanup (which you can also adjust below).
#
# Combine this with an extension attribute to read that file, a Smart Computer 
# Group to drop machines into a target group to run a policy at reoccuring 
# check-in, and a policy that reads that file and runs a jamf deleteAccount 
# command to kill that account.
