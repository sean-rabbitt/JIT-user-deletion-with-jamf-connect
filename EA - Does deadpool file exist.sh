# PART TWO: Extension Attribute - Does the deadpool file exist
#
# WHY: Jamf Connect allows for just-in-time account creation on a macOS client.
# So this means that an admin may want to just pop in and do some magic, log out
# and go away.  But there's no easy way to clean up after yourself, and like any
# good Girl Scout, we should always leave our campsite better than when we found
# it.

# HOW: 	1) Create an extension attribute with this script to look for the 
#			presence of file located at $DELETE_USER_TOUCH_FILE (defined below)
#		3) Create a Smart Computer Group based on the extension attribute above
#			and that the file exists
#		4) Create a policy that runs at reoccuring checkin, scoped to computers
#			that belong to the Smart Computer Group above.  Tell the policy to 
#			the delete a list of users script..

# WHAT: EA will return "TRUE" if the deadpool file user list exists.
